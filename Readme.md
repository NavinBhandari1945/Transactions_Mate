Project Overview
This project is a prototype desktop application for personal expense tracking, developed using .NET Core and Visual Studio 2022. The application enables users to manage cash inflows, outflows, and debts efficiently while providing insights through a detailed dashboard.

Features

  - Track debts, including the source, due date, and payment constraints.
  - Debt Highlighting: Pending debts are emphasized until cleared.
- Transaction Customization:
  - Assign predefined or custom tags for organization (e.g., rent, groceries).
  - Add optional notes to transactions.
- Data Processing & Organization:
  - Search, filter, and sort transactions based on type, tags, date range, and title.
  - Dashboard statistics: Displays inflows, outflows, total balance, debt details, and top transactions.
  - Pending Debts: Clearly listed on the dashboard.
  - Date Range Filtering: Default to the current month, adjustable as needed.
- Data Storage & Export:
  - Supports structured formats like JSON.
- User Experience & Security:
  - Secure authentication for user access.
  - Clean, intuitive, and responsive UI.

Development Considerations
- Architectural Pattern: Follows best practices for modularity and maintainability.
- Error Handling: Implements exception handling, input validation, and logging.
- Version Control: Uses Git for effective source management.
- Scalability & Performance: Optimized data structures and algorithms for efficiency.


This project ensures efficient personal financial management with a structured and user-friendly approach.
